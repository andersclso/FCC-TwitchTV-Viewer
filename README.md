# Freecodecamp Intermediate Front End Development Project
Build an app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/Myvqmo/.

## Project Criteria:
* User Story: I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.
* User Story: I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.
* User Story: if a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.
